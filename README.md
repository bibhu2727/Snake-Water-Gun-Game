## Overview

The **Snake Water Gun Game** is a graphical application where players choose one of three options to play against the computer. The game follows the classic rules where each choice can win against, lose to, or draw with another choice. The project showcases the use of Python for creating games with interactive UI elements and sound effects.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** A clean and interactive interface built with `tkinter`.
- **Sound Effects:** Engaging sounds for actions like button clicks, winning, losing, and drawing, using the `pygame` mixer.
- **Game Logic:** Implemented rules for the classic game where:
  - **Snake** beats **Water**
  - **Water** beats **Gun**
  - **Gun** beats **Snake**
- **Custom Font:** A unique signature font for the developerâ€™s credit.

To get started with the **Snake Water Gun Game**, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the `pygame` and `Pillow` libraries. 

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bibhu2727/Snake-Water-Gun-Game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash

Ensure that you have the following files in the same directory as `main.py`:

- `click.wav`: Sound effect for button clicks.
- `win.wav`: Sound effect for winning.
- `lose.wav`: Sound effect for losing.
- `draw.wav`: Sound effect for a draw.
- `snake.png`: Image representing "Snake".
- `water.png`: Image representing "Water".
- `gun.png`: Image representing "Gun".

## Game Rules

In the game, you and the computer will choose one of three options:
